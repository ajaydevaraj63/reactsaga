These events include virtual gatherings to celebrate values and team camaraderie, as well as the highly anticipated Annual Spotify Star Jam. Depending on the circumstances, the Jam can be either an in-person or virtual event. The top ten contributors may visit Spotify's head offices for an all-expenses-paid experience, while all Stars can participate online, with the top ten contributors receiving additional exclusive calls and meetings. These events involve dedicated workshops, team-building activities, and interactions with Spotify.Considering the program's foundation in music, participants also have access to Premium perks. Active and consistent contributors become eligible for the Quarterly Free Premium initiative, providing them with free Premium access. Additionally, participants can redeem their points for regular Premium subscriptions, although Family, Student, and Duo plans are not currently available for redemption.In summary, being a part of the Spotify Star ranks offers a range of benefits, including a close connection to Spotify, insights, skill development, branded swag, exclusive events, and Premium perks. It is a rewarding experience that recognizes and appreciates the contributions of participants in the Spotify Community."]}

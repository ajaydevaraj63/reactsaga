On mobile, ensure that you have not accidentally hidden anything with a filter by pulling down the screen to view your filters.

First, check the @SpotifyStatus Twitter account to see if there are any ongoing issues reported by Spotify. Make sure that Spotify is not in offline mode by checking the app's Settings under Playback. If you're using a data connection, ensure that you have enough data allowance or consider using a WiFi connection if possible. Check your router and make sure that UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is enabled. If it's already enabled, try turning it off and then on again.Verify that your router allows both inbound and outbound connections for Spotify and ensure that your firewall software permits Spotify access. Temporarily disabling any antivirus, anti-hack, or other security software may help identify if they are causing conflicts with Spotify. Restart your router by turning it off for 10 minutes and then turning it back on. If you're using a shared or public network such as those in schools or offices, contact the network administrators for more information on any restrictions.If possible, test Spotify with a different WiFi network to determine if the issue is specific to your network. If it works on another network, contacting your original service provider is recommended. Additionally, consider the following factors: check if the issue occurs on both WiFi and mobile data connections, be aware that VPNs may cause access issues to Spotify webpages, consider your location as Spotify may not be available everywhere, and take note of any specific hours when the issue frequently occurs, as heavy internet traffic during those times may contribute to the problem.If you have set the streaming quality to 'High,' it may require a stronger connection, which can lead to issues in areas with weak connectivity. You can confirm if this is the case by conducting a speed test using a trusted site like http://www.speedtest.net/.If you have recently deleted a playlist within the last 90 days, there are two ways to recover it. The first method is to use the playlist recovery feature. To do this, log in to your Spotify account page, navigate to the menu on the left, and click on 'Recover playlists.'

For Mac users, press Cmd+Z, and for Windows users, press Ctrl+Shift+Z. This keyboard shortcut will immediately undo the deletion and restore the playlist or item you deleted.Sometimes, users report issues with Spotify's shuffle feature not working properly.

On the other hand, if an idea is marked as  Case Closed,  it signifies that it has been discussed internally but is not currently part of Spotify's immediate timeline.However, this doesn't rule out the possibility of revisiting and implementing the idea in the future.While votes play a crucial role in determining the popularity and support for an idea, they are not the sole determining factor in Spotify's decision-making process. The company also takes into account various other aspects, including their commitment to supporting artists, data analysis and insights, research testing, feedback from the Community and other support channels, and alignment with their overall short- and long-term business strategy.Furthermore, even if Spotify introduces a feature or improvement that originated independently of the Community, they make it a point to acknowledge the corresponding idea within the Community, regardless of its vote count, and provide an announcement.Overall, the Idea Exchange serves as a valuable platform for users to contribute their ideas, and Spotify considers a range of factors alongside votes to shape their future developments and enhancements.

				when creating a new thread, make sure to choose 
				the appropriate category that aligns with the topic of your post.
				This helps keep the discussions organized and relevant. Secondly, 
				it's essential to keep your posts on-topic and related to the thread's subject matter.
               To maintain a diverse and engaging environment, refrain from posting the same track or playlist URI multiple times within the same thread or more than once within a 10-day period in Chat. This prevents repetitive content and encourages variety in the discussions. Additionally, avoid posting anything that aims to generate commercial profit, such as requests for rewards, transactions, or exchanges of favors. Chat is intended for community interaction and sharing, rather than commercial activities.
               When sharing links to music or podcasts, it's encouraged to use Spotify whenever possible. However, if the content you wish to share is not available on Spotify, you may post links from other channels. The focus is to facilitate discussions and introduce users to new and interesting content.
                By adhering to these guidelines, users can contribute to a positive and engaging Chat experience, fostering meaningful discussions and promoting a sense of community within the Spotify platform.

A good starting point is a brief description of your current experience with the app. Once you covered the functionality of the app as it is right now, you can move on to explaining what exactly it is you would like to change. 

 

Avoid writing  make this feature better  as that could mean different things to different people, and instead try describing a specific improvement you’d like to see implemented and which section (Your Library, Home, Browse, artist pages, etc.) or platform (mobile, desktop, web player, speaker, etc.) this would affect.

 

It can also be helpful to add screenshots or link to a related idea and explain in what way your idea is different.

				 text : The Spotify app offers compatibility with accessibility settings on various devices, allowing users to enhance their Spotify experience based on their individual needs. Whether you're using iOS or Android, you can customize the app's accessibility settings to suit your preferences.
For iOS users, the Spotify app provides options such as mono audio, which plays the same audio through both left and right speakers, creating a balanced sound experience. Normalize volume ensures that songs are played at consistent levels, preventing sudden volume changes between tracks. The volume level can be adjusted according to your environment, allowing you to set the optimal sound level. If you find the short, looping visuals on tracks distracting, you can easily turn off the Canvas feature.
Additionally, certain Spotify Originals podcasts have auto-generated transcripts available as part of a limited beta test. Users can enable VoiceOver, which provides audible descriptions of on-screen elements, and adjust the motion settings to reduce or stop the movement of certain elements. Those with Bluetooth wireless Braille displays can connect them to their device for reading VoiceOver output.

The Motion setting allows users to reduce or stop the movement of certain screen elements. By connecting a Bluetooth wireless Braille display, users can read the output of VoiceOver through touch. The Zoom feature enables users to zoom in or out on specific items, while the Speak screen option allows them to hear the entire screen without VoiceOver turned on. Users can also adjust the text size using the Font Size slider in the Large Text Size setting. Smart Invert Colors reverses the display colors, except for images, media, and some dark-themed apps. Voice control allows users to control their iPhone using only their voice. The Mono Audio setting combines the left and right audio channels to play the same content. The Balance setting enables users to adjust the volume balance between the left and right speakers or headphones. Phone noise cancellation uses air pressure to reduce ambient background noise during phone calls in noisy environments. Additionally, the Spotify app is compatible with Siri voice commands.

If you have previously had lyrics on your account, there are a few steps you can take to check if lyrics are available for specific tracks. Firstly, make sure you are not in Offline Mode. Next, try accessing the lyrics for songs in a testing playlist that Spotify has created. If you can view the lyrics for some tracks, it means that the track you're currently listening to may not have lyrics available. However, if you can't see lyrics for any of the tracks, you can try basic troubleshooting steps such as ensuring your Spotify app is updated to version 8.5.56 or higher, logging out and back into the app multiple times (while fully quitting the app each time), or performing a thorough reinstallation of the app.

				 text : In response to numerous requests from the community, many people have expressed their desire for specific tracks, albums, or artists to be added to Spotify. While Spotify aims to make all the world's music available, the availability of songs is dependent on obtaining permissions from the rights holders. Nevertheless, Spotify continues to add new music every week, and it is hopeful that the desired choices will be included in the future.
If you are unable to find a particular item in your library, there are a few things you can check. On mobile, ensure that you have not accidentally hidden anything with a filter by pulling down the screen to view your filters. If that is not the case, it's possible that you have the item saved on a different Spotify account. In such cases, try logging out and then logging back in with alternative login details.
If you still cannot locate the item, it is possible that it did not save correctly to your library. To find it, use the search function on Spotify and try liking or adding it to your library again by clicking the green heart icon.
In the event that you suspect unauthorized access to your account, refer to the  Think your account's been hacked?  section for further assistance and steps to secure your account. .

				 text : If you're experiencing connection issues with Spotify, there are several troubleshooting steps you can try. First, check the @SpotifyStatus Twitter account to see if there are any ongoing issues reported by Spotify. Make sure that Spotify is not in offline mode by checking the app's Settings under Playback. If you're using a data connection, ensure that you have enough data allowance or consider using a WiFi connection if possible. Check your router and make sure that UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is enabled. If it's already enabled, try turning it off and then on again.
Verify that your router allows both inbound and outbound connections for Spotify and ensure that your firewall software permits Spotify access. Temporarily disabling any antivirus, anti-hack, or other security software may help identify if they are causing conflicts with Spotify. Restart your router by turning it off for 10 minutes and then turning it back on. If you're using a shared or public network such as those in schools or offices, contact the network administrators for more information on any restrictions.
If possible, test Spotify with a different WiFi network to determine if the issue is specific to your network. If it works on another network, contacting your original service provider is recommended. Additionally, consider the following factors: check if the issue occurs on both WiFi and mobile data connections, be aware that VPNs may cause access issues to Spotify webpages, consider your location as Spotify may not be available everywhere, and take note of any specific hours when the issue frequently occurs, as heavy internet traffic during those times may contribute to the problem.
If you have set the streaming quality to 'High,' it may require a stronger connection, which can lead to issues in areas with weak connectivity. You can confirm if this is the case by conducting a speed test using a trusted site like http://www.speedtest.net/.
